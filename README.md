## What spec-driven design is

Spec-driven design is an approach where **the spec is the main work artifact, not the code**. The code is the consequence.

It sounds obvious. The difference from the classic "document before coding" is that in spec-driven the spec **is not optional or decorative**: it's the contract that guides execution, it's versioned in git, and it's kept alive. If the code diverges from the spec, one of the two is wrong.

Each spec captures the decisions of a single feature. Specs live in `specs/` as `.md` files numbered sequentially, and they form the project's design decision log.

---

## The problem it solves

When you work with an LLM like Claude Code, there's a very concrete phenomenon: if you ask it _"build me an Arkanoid with power-ups and levels"_, **it's going to improvise**. It's going to make 50 implicit design decisions (classes or functions? global or local state? how are entities named?) without you seeing any of them. And each one of those decisions becomes an expensive coupling to revert later.

The problem isn't new — humans improvise too — but with an LLM it's sharper:

1. **Generation speed hides the cost of decisions.** When a human takes two hours to write a module, they have time to think. When Claude does it in 30 seconds, the decisions go invisible.
2. **Every conversation starts from scratch.** Without a spec, in the next session Claude doesn't know what you decided before and is going to improvise again, possibly in the opposite direction.
3. **Context fills up fast.** Without a stable document to refer to, you end up pasting context by hand into every prompt.

The spec solves all three: it makes decisions explicit, it persists across sessions, and it loads once as a reference.

```

### 1. Describe

You describe the feature to Claude in terms of **the problem**, not the solution. If you dictate the solution, Claude just formats it — you lose its ability to propose structure.

### 2. Plan mode

You activate plan mode (in plan mode Claude can't write files, only read and propose). Claude responds with a structured document: scope, data model, implementation plan, and acceptance criteria.

### 3. Refine

You read the plan with resistance and give **concrete decisions**. "Take X out of scope", "data lives in JSON, not in JS modules", "add a risks section". You iterate 2-3 times.

### 4. Save

When the spec is honed, you save it in `specs/NN-slug.md` with status `Draft`. You leave the chat, **re-read it outside the editor**, and only when you're satisfied do you change the status to `Approved` manually. That change is made by the human, not Claude.

### 5. Execute

You exit plan mode and ask Claude to implement the spec **step by step**, stopping after each step in the implementation plan. The pause between steps is what makes the method work.

### 6. Review

After each step, you review the diff. If it's good, you continue. If not, you correct in the moment — not at the end with 600 lines mixed together.

---

## Anatomy of a useful spec

Not every document does the job. A useful spec has six parts — if any of them is missing, it's probably not enough to guide execution.

### 1. Goal in one sentence

If it doesn't fit in a sentence, the feature is too big. Split it before writing anything else.

### 2. Explicit scope + what's NOT in scope

The "out of scope" is as important as the "in scope". Without it, the boundaries are blurry and scope creep appears during implementation. Capture the things that were mentioned but decided to postpone.

### 3. Data model

Concrete structures and names. If you say "the levels module", say `src/levels.js`. If you say "a key", give the exact string. This section is the one most cited later in other specs and skills.

### 4. Ordered implementation plan

Numbered sequential steps. **Each step must leave the system in a working state.** If a step requires more than 30-50 lines of code, split it. The last step is not "test everything" — that's the acceptance criteria.

### 5. Acceptance criteria

A verifiable boolean checklist. Each item can be answered yes or no.

- ❌ "Works well" — not verifiable
- ❌ "Good UX" — subjective
- ❌ "No bugs" — not operational
- ✅ "Pressing Esc pauses the game and shows the menu" — verifiable

### 6. Decisions made and discarded

What you considered and why you chose what you chose. **This is gold three months from now** when someone asks _"why does persistence use a versioned key?"_. The answer lives there.

Each decision ideally has a short reason. Decisions without a reason are the first ones questioned later.

---

## When to use specs and when not

This architecture has a cost. Don't apply it to everything.

### YES — write a spec when:

- The task will touch **more than two files**.
- There are **decisions expensive to revert** (data schemas, formats, APIs).
- The feature will take **more than one session** of Claude Code.
- There's a **contract that other artifacts will reuse** (another spec, a skill, a hook).
- It's something you'll **forget about in a week**.

### NO — use a direct prompt when:

- It's a **point bug fix**.
- It's a **mechanical refactor** (renames, file moves).
- It's an **exploratory experiment** where the goal is to discover the decision, not execute it.
- The task **fits in a prompt** and is understood at first read.
- It's a **one-off task** that won't be repeated.

### Mental rule

> **If you're tempted to open plan mode, you probably need it.** > **If planning the feature bores you, you probably don't.**

Common sense beats the rule — but common sense is trained by the two columns above.

---

## Rules almost nobody follows

Four usage patterns that distinguish the method working well from the method as decorative bureaucracy:

### 1. In the description phase, describe the problem, not the solution

❌ _"Add an array of levels loaded from JSON, a `loadLevel()` function, and persistence with versioned localStorage."_

That's already a spec poorly written by you. Claude is just going to format it.

✅ _"I want the game to stop being single-screen. The next feature is: progression through levels with increasing difficulty, and persistence of high scores across sessions."_

That second version leaves room for Claude to **decide** and you to **review**. That's the nature of the flow.

### 2. In the refine phase, give concrete decisions, not suggestions

Plan mode is where **you direct**. "Take X out", "the format is JSON", "add risks". If you say "I think maybe it would be good to...", Claude is going to leave it as is.

### 3. During execution, ask for pauses between steps

The difference is:

- **Without pauses:** Claude dumps 400 lines. You review a giant commit. If something is wrong in step 2, it's mixed with changes from steps 5 and 6. Painful.
- **With pauses:** Claude dumps 50-80 lines (step 1). You read the diff. You approve or adjust. It moves to step 2. Each step is a clean commit. Reverting is trivial.

### 4. If mid-execution you want to change something, you go back to step 2 — never improvise

Mid-implementation something occurs to you. The right move is: stop, go back to plan mode, update the spec, exit, continue. **Don't improvise on the code.**

That separation is what prevents silent scope creep.

## Installation

### Option 1 — skills.sh (recommended, Claude Code)

```bash
npx skills@latest add inerhead/gossio-skills
```

To uninstall:

```bash
npx skills@latest remove inerhead/gossio-skills
```


### Option 2 — Other agents (Cursor, Codex, Antigravity)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inerhead/gossio-skills ~/.gossio-skills
cd ~/your-project
~/.gossio-skills/scripts/install-to-agent.sh <agent>
```

`<agent>` can be `claude`, `cursor`, `codex`, or `antigravity`.

| Agent         | What gets written                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude`      | Symlinks each skill into `.claude/skills/` (project-scoped)                           |
| `cursor`      | Generates `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc` files. Invoke with `@spec`, `@spec-impl`, etc.   |
| `codex`       | Adds a `## Skills` block to `AGENTS.md` and copies skill bodies into `.codex/skills/` |
| `antigravity` | Copies skill bodies into `.antigravity/skills/`                                       |

> Cursor and Codex don't natively support Claude Code's `argument-hint` or `disable-model-invocation` frontmatter. The installer drops those fields and keeps the body — the workflow is the same, only the trigger changes.

### Option 3 — Manual

```bash
# Personal (all your projects)
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r skills/engineering/spec ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r skills/engineering/spec-impl ~/.claude/skills/

# Or per-project (versioned in git)
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r skills/engineering/spec .claude/skills/
cp -r skills/engineering/spec-impl .claude/skills/
```

For the method to work, you also need to create the `specs/` folder at the project root:

```bash
mkdir specs
```

Optionally, add a `specs/README.md` documenting the convention (see the example in this repo).

---

## Usage

### Full feature cycle

```bash
# 1. Design the spec with clarifying questions
/spec levels-and-highscores

# Claude reads the project-memory file (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, or README.md) and existing specs/, asks questions
# in blocks, develops the spec section by section,
# and finally saves it as specs/03-levels-and-highscores.md
# with status: Draft.

# 2. Re-read the spec outside the chat and approve it manually
# (open the file in the editor, change Status: Draft → Approved)

# 3. Implement the approved spec
/spec-impl 03-levels-and-highscores

# Claude validates the status is Approved, creates the branch
# spec-03-levels-and-highscores, switches to it, shows
# the spec summary, and starts the step-by-step implementation
# with pauses to review diffs.
```

### What each skill does

#### `/spec [short-topic]`

Designs the feature document. Goes through four phases:

1. **Context** — reads the project-memory file (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `README.md`, whichever exists first) and previous specs.
2. **Clarification** — asks questions in blocks of 3-5 until the feature is clearly defined.
3. **Section by section development** — generates and confirms each spec section before moving on.
4. **Save** — writes the file in `specs/NN-slug.md` with status `Draft`.

#### `/spec-impl <NN-name>`

Implements an approved spec. Goes through four phases:

1. **Identify** — locates the spec file.
2. **Validate** — verifies the status is `Approved`. If not, it stops.
3. **Create branch** — `git checkout -b spec-NN-slug` and switches to it.
4. **Implement** — step by step with pauses, showing the spec summary first.

> **Branch control:** Phase 3 reads the `AutoCreateBranch` flag from `specs/.spec-config.yml`. It defaults to `true` (creates the branch automatically). Set it to `false` to make `/spec-impl` ask `[y/N]` before creating any branch — useful if branch naming is part of your own Git workflow.

> ```yaml
> # specs/.spec-config.yml
> AutoCreateBranch: false
> ```

### Spec states

| State         | Meaning                                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Draft`       | The `/spec` skill generated it but the human hasn't re-read it.            |
| `In review`   | The human is reviewing or iterating with Claude.                           |
| `Approved`    | The human read and authorized it. `/spec-impl` only works with this state. |
| `Implemented` | The code exists and passes the acceptance criteria.                        |
| `Obsolete`    | Replaced by another spec. Not deleted — referenced.                        |

**Changing the status to `Approved` is a deliberate human act.** It's the only signature on the contract — Claude can't approve its own work.

> Status labels are language-agnostic. `/spec-impl` only requires the status to mean **Approved** — `Approved`, `Aprobado`, or the equivalent in any language all work. Same goes for the other states. Pick the labels your team prefers and stay consistent.

## Why the two skills work as a pair

│             ↓                                             │
│             branch spec-NN-slug + code                    │
│                                                           │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The gap between the two skills — re-reading and changing the status by hand — is deliberate. It's the only moment where **only you can do something**. Without that gap, the method degrades to "Claude writes pretty documentation and then writes whatever code occurs to it anyway".
